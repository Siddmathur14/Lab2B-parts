# LAB ON CHIP

- The following demonstration video shows color data acquired from the APDS9960 sensor, which is sent to the neopixel LED, based on highest component of red, green and blue.

- The process for implementing this part was very similar to part 08_apds_protocol.
- Once the raw data was acquired from the APDS9960 it was processed, and converted into a 24 bit color packet.
- This packet was created based on the highest component among the red, green and the blue channel.
- In this implementation 2 state machines were used, one of them was to interface the APDS9960 sensor and the other one was used to drive the neopixel LED
