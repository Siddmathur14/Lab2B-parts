# PROPOSAL


-The proposal is updated to guessing game calLed higher_lower, where the user is asked to enter a number that would be considered as a seed to generate a random number.

- Based on the generated random number whose function can be found here.

- Then, the user is asked to enter a guess and based on whether the value entered is higher or lower than the random number generated, the user is prompted by printing Think higher!! or Think Lower!!.

- Until the user guesses the correct answer the RED LED blinks at each guess, once the user guesses the right answer the BLUE LED blinks, and the game mode is exited.
