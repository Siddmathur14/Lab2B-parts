# Feedback for Lab2B


Q) Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).


- I found some of the parts unclear in terms of what was expected and the deliverables. I did not have a lot of experience with embedded systems , register level implementation and assembly language. So, I found this lab a little too fast paced and felt like I was not equipped well enough for some of the parts. 


Q) Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.
