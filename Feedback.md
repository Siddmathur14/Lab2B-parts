# Feedback for Lab2B


Q) Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).


- I found some of the parts unclear in terms of what was expected and the deliverables. I did not have a lot of experience with embedded systems , register level implementation and assembly language. So, I found this lab a little too fast paced and felt like I was not equipped well enough for some of the parts. 
-  The description for part 08_apds_protocol which read, "...to implement the ADPS9960 protocol and control the sensor." was confusing.
-  Part 6 wanted us to work with a partner and their QTPy. Different approaches in taking a record a timestamped trace led to a mismatch and took a lot of time to resolve.


Q) Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? E.g., "serial communication with Python," "aliased bitwise operations," "programming the PIO," etc. Be specific, and describe any lingering areas of confusion and/or anything that has helped you navigate them.

- I found the serial communication with Python part a little hard to understand.
- Working on .pio files using assembly was hard to navigate around because of lack of in-depth understanding.
- Replicating communication protocols without having a complete understanding was also a little problematic

Q)Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement? Again, be specific, citing any parts of the lab materials & your own code that are relevant to your answer.

- Personally , I found all parts from 6 onwards quite challenging because they used pre existing examples and codes to which we were supposed to make modifications. From 6 onwards , it required an extensive understanding of .pio files and assembly code which was challenging. Using the DMA peripheral also posed a lot of problems.Parts 8 and 9 were very challenging and I don't feel like I had enough knowledge to implement them.

Q) What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties? Any other barriers you have faced to completing this assignment? Mention any students, repos, or other resources you have found helpful in completing the lab so far.

- I had to work with friends and it took a lot of time to figure things out. We had to go through the SDK, datasheet and the RP2040 assembly guide book to even figure out things like how pio worked. Again , I think many of us did not have enough knowledge or experience with embedded systems and it took a lot of reading to figure out most things. I feel like the theory classes should have supplemented the lab tasks so that we had some sort of a base to work around.
